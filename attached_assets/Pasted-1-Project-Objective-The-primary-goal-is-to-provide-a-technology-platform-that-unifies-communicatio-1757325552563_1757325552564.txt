1. Project Objective
The primary goal is to provide a technology platform that unifies communication between elderly users, their families, and socio-sanitary professionals. The platform will offer simple tools for cognitive stimulation, emotional support, and personal information management to promote autonomy and active aging.

2. Core User Roles
The MVP will support three distinct user roles with different permissions and functionalities:
Persona Mayor (Elderly User): The main user of the platform, interacting through accessible interfaces.
Familiar (Family Member/Caregiver): A remote user who supports and coordinates care for the elderly user.
Personal Municipal (Municipal/Professional Staff): A supervisor who oversees multiple users to monitor for inactivity and coordinate local activities.

3. Key MVP Features

Secure, Role-Based Authentication: Each user role will have a distinct and secure login method.


AI Virtual Assistant: An interactive chat module for conversation and cognitive exercises, using the DeepSeek API with a simple RAG system.




Reminder System: A shared calendar for medical appointments, medication schedules, and other important events.


Dashboards: Tailored views for family members and professionals to monitor user activity and coordinate care.


4. User Flows & Screen Functional Logic

This section details the logic for the ~12 core screens of the MVP.

Flow 1: Persona Mayor (Elderly User)


Screen 1: Simplified Login: A screen with a large numeric keypad for PIN-based authentication.

Screen 2: Main Menu: A simple dashboard with 3-4 large, icon-driven buttons to access the main sections (AI Assistant, Reminders, Family Messages).

Screen 3: AI Assistant (Chat): A full-screen, high-contrast chat interface for conversing with the AI. It will be used for companionship and to perform memory exercises.



Screen 4: Reminders View: A clear, read-only list of today's reminders (e.g., medical appointments, medication times).

Flow 2: Familiar (Family Member/Caregiver)

Screen 5: Standard Login: A standard email and password login form.


Screen 6: Family Dashboard: An overview screen showing the elderly user's recent activity, status, and any alerts (e.g., inactivity).


Screen 7: Manage Reminders: A full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface to manage the elderly user's appointments and medication schedules.


Screen 8: Activity History: A view to review the user's interaction history on the platform.


Screen 9: Send Message/Photo: A simple form to send short messages or share photos with the elderly user.

Flow 3: Personal Municipal (Professional Staff)

Screen 10: Professional Login: A standard email and password login for professional accounts.

Screen 11: Supervision Dashboard: A list view of all assigned elderly users. Each entry will show the user's name, last activity date, and an alert icon for prolonged inactivity.


Screen 12: User Detail View (Read-Only): A read-only version of the Family Dashboard, allowing the professional to review a specific user's authorized information and activity to detect needs.

5. Technical Stack & Key Requirements

Frontend: React (Next.js) + MUI (Material-UI) Component Library.

Backend: Node.js (Fastify/Express).

Database: PostgreSQL.


Deployment: The entire application must be containerized with Docker.

AI Integration: Must use the DeepSeek API and include a simple RAG implementation. The RAG data source will be a small, Something like Excel with information about each user that the healthcare provider enters into the database.

Security: All communications must be encrypted, and data-at-rest must be protected. The system must adhere to role-based access control.
